## Finishing Challange to build Shortly URL shorteningðŸ‘‹
This is Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
